# session-time-analyzer

Hey Security Community! 👋 Let me share a fun story about how I turned a frustrating session timeout problem into an opportunity for some creative problem-solving.

Picture this: You're deep into testing multiple APIs, and boom - your session expires every 3 minutes. Not cool, right? That's exactly what pushed me to create what I'm now calling the Session Time Analyzer. Let me walk you through this journey of automation and clever workarounds!

**🎯 The Problem That Started It All**

Imagine being told you have to work with a system that kicks you out every 3 minutes of inactivity. Yes, you read that right - THREE minutes! As a security tester, this was like being asked to complete a marathon while stopping to tie your shoelaces every 100 meters. Not happening!

**🛠️ The Solution: A Python-Powered Session Maestro**
Instead of accepting defeat, I built a tool that turned this limitation into a non-issue. Here's what makes it special:

**First, the Basics:**
- Takes your Burp Suite requests (just copy and paste!)
- Runs them automatically with customizable timing
- Extracts and saves tokens for later use
- Shows pretty colored outputs (because who doesn't love a good UI?)

But here's where it gets interesting...



**🌟 My Real-World Battle Story**

Remember those 7 different APIs I mentioned? Each with its own authentication? Here's how I tackled it:

1. The Token Dance: Set up the script to request fresh JWT tokens every minute
2. The Orchestration: Managed 7 different authentication flows simultaneously
3. The Integration: Used mitmproxy as the maestro, conducting this entire token symphony
4. The Result: Smooth, uninterrupted testing for hours!



**🎮 How to Join the Fun:**

1. Copy your request from Burp Suite → Save it (request.txt)
2. Configure the batch wrapper file (just comment out what you don't need with '::' or 'REM')
3. Set up your patterns.txt with your search criteria
4. Drag & Drop → Watch the magic happen!



**🎯 The Cool Use Cases:**

• Session Keepalive: Never see that timeout message again!

• Token Validity Testing: Find exact timeout durations

• Response Monitoring: With regex, string matching, and pretty colors

• Token Extraction: Perfect for feeding into other tools




**🔥 The Ultimate Workflow**

Here's my favorite part - how I combined everything into a super-workflow:
1. Used the script to maintain active sessions
2. Generated fresh tokens every minute
3. Integrated with mitmproxy to automatically update authorization headers
4. Ran sqlmap through this setup for continuous testing

Think of it as a security testing assembly line, where each component handles its part perfectly!



**💡 Pro Tips From the Trenches:**
- Use different colors for different response patterns
- Set up separate token files for each API
- Let the batch wrapper handle the complexity
- Remember: Automation is your friend!

**P.S.:** Yes, I automated my way around a 3-minute timeout. Some might call it stubborn, I call it "creatively persistent" 😉

**P.P.S.:** Remember, the best solutions often come from the most annoying problems. Keep hacking, keep automating! 🚀
